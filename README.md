I was just bored and decided to make a neon css for those who want use neon in their design as my first public repo and i'll try to develop it and make it better ;)
How it actually works ?
this repo contains both css and scss (you can edit vars.scss file for cusomize your neon) files and built-in css classes for making neon.
