I was just **bored** and decided to make a neon css for those who want use neon in their design as my first public repo and i'll try to develop it and make it usefull ;)
## How it actually **works** ?
This repo contains both css and scss (you can edit vars.scss file for cusomize your neon) files and built-in css classes for making neon.
Use `neon` class to make neon borders and use `neon-text` to convert a text to neon! <br><br>
`neon-tick`,`neon-rotate` and `neon-text-tick` are aloso available for adding animation to your neon.
<br><br>Wish you best :)


## Todo list
- [ ] adding different colors for neon boxes
- [ ] adding different colors for neon texts
- [ ] text stroke neon
- [ ] neon button
- [ ] neon loadings
- [ ] custom text neon in mixin.scss
- [ ] combining tick and rotate animations together
